# Loan Management System

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to create an API to manage the loan payments control system from a fintech.

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to test your ability to implement a solution given an abstract problem. You may find a problem in the asked task that you need to explain the problem and propose a solution to fix it. 

## Problem
A fintech needs to keep track of the amount of money loaned and the missed/made payments. It also needs a place to retrieve the volume of outstanding debt at some point in time.

## Limitations
Loans are paid back in monthly installments.

## Endpoints

### POST /loans

#### Summary

Create a loan application. Loans are automatically accepted.

#### Payload

- amount: loan amount in dollars.
- term: number of months that will take until the loan gets paid-off.
- rate: interest rate as decimal.
- date: when the loan was requested (origination date as an ISO 8601 string).

#### Example of sent data

    {
        "amount": 1000,
        "term": 12,
        "rate": 0.05,
        "date": "2019-05-09 03:18Z"
    }

#### Reply

- loan_id: unique id of the loan. 
- installment: monthly loan payment.

#### Example of received data

    {
        "loan_id": "000-0000-0000-0000"
        "installment": 85.60
    }

#### Notes

Loan payment formula

    r = rate / 12
    installment = [r + r / ((1 + r) ^ term - 1)] x amount

#### Example

For repaying a loan of $1000 at 5% interest for 12 months, the equation would be:

    installment = [(0.05 / 12) + (0.05 / 12) / ((1 + (0.05 / 12)) ^ 12 - 1] x 1000
    installment = 85.60

### POST /loans/<:id>/payments
